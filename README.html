    <h1>GitHub Repository Name: Bayesian_Network_analysis</h1>
    
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    
    <h2>Project Name: Rayuela</h2>
    
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>The "Bayesian_Network_analysis" GitHub repository is a collaborative project under the name "Rayuela" aimed at developing various Bayesian network models to understand and define the complex relationships between different factors that identify various cyber delinquency activities in teenagers. These cyber delinquency activities are specifically linked to a unique set of video games designed for this purpose.</p>
    
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of this repository is to employ Bayesian network analysis as a powerful statistical tool to model and explore the intricate web of factors contributing to cyber delinquency in teenagers. By focusing on the impact of specific video games, the project aims to gain insights into how these digital environments may influence adolescent behavior.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong> The repository contains tools and scripts for collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing datasets related to teenage cyber delinquency, including information on the specific video games associated with these activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Bayesian Network Models:</strong> Multiple Bayesian network models are developed and stored within the repository. Each model is designed to represent the probabilistic relationships between various factors contributing to cyber delinquency, such as game usage patterns, social interactions, and psychological profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> The repository includes visualization scripts and notebooks to help users explore and interpret the results of Bayesian network analysis. Visualizations can provide insights into causal relationships, conditional probabilities, and risk factors.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Detailed documentation is provided to explain the methodology, data sources, and the structure of Bayesian network models used in the project. This documentation facilitates collaboration and helps users understand the project's findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration and Issues:</strong> GitHub's collaboration features are leveraged to encourage contributions and feedback from the research community. Users can submit issues, suggest improvements, or collaborate on model development.</li>
        <li><strong>License:</strong> The repository specifies the licensing terms, ensuring that the project is accessible to a wide audience for academic, research, and educational purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How to Contribute:</h3>
